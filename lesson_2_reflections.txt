What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A git repository is created. This creates a new repository to store commits and track their changes, along with 
the necessary metadata.

Use git add to add a commit to your repository. If you accidentally add a file to the staging area, you can remove it using git reset. For example, if you accidentally add lesson_2_reflections.txt, but donâ€™t want it to be committed yet, run git reset lesson_2_reflections.txt and the file will be removed from the staging area, but it will still be in your working directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different in that it is not a final recording like that of a created working directory or 
repository. It serves as an intermediate area to ensure that you  commit exactly what you intend to.

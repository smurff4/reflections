When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Perhaps when working on a project with others so that data can be pushed and pulled.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I may not consider all changes significant enough to commit and would rather wait to determine a significant or logical enough change for a commit
